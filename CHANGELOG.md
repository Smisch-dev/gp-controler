## v1.0.0-alpha.2
### Added
* Ability to run an installation process for a server and notify the panel when completed.
* Output from the installation process is now emitted over the server console for administrative users to view.

### Fixed
* Fixed bugs caused when unmarshaling data into a struct with default values.
* Timezone is properly set in containers by using the `TZ=` environment variable rather than mounting timezone data into the filesystem.
* Server data directly is now properly created when running the install process.
* Time drift caused in the socket JWT is now handled in a better manner and less likely to unexpectedly error out.
